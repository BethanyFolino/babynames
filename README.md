# Baby Names
Baby Names is a project I did as part of Kenzie Academy's software engineering program. I was supposed to modify the main(args) in the babynames.py file to make it call the extract_names(filename) function and print what it returns. I was supposed to be able to get the program to sort through a list of baby names in one of the HTML files provided by Kenzie Academy and only print out the first instance of each name and the corresponding rank. Each list of baby names features many instances of names that appear as girl names AND boy names. I used lists to sort the file of baby names, which is not the usual approach to this project. The tests in this project were made by Kenzie Academy staff.
